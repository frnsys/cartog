# carto

Small JS library for building simple management simulators/games, built on top of p5js.

Developed for the Simulation & Cybernetics class at The New School.

More than anything it's meant to let students focus on the system design of their games rather than worry about the nitty-gritty of implementing stuff like menus. In the interest of avoiding causing additional complexity for students, the framework is simple, and so somewhat limited, but hopefully still expressive enough for students to explore a wide variety of interesting domains.

Speaking to the limitations: `carto` is designed for games that involve a top-down 2D grid and are focused on resource management. The primary interactions it supports are menu-based and grid-clicking. Through a basic event/modal system, `carto` should be able to handle a decent amount of dialogue narrative.

This is an early first version that will evolve as the needs of the class become clearer.

# Example

See `index.html` and `main.js`.

# Setup

In your script you need to include the following:

`STATE`, an object that must at least have a `resources` key. For example:

```
const STATE = {
  resources: {
    cash: 1000,
    water: 100
  }
}
```

`RESOURCES`, which map resource names to their in-game representation, e.g:

```
const RESOURCES = {
  cash: 'ðŸ’µ',
  water: 'ðŸš°'
};
```

These are automatically rendered as part of the UI.

`IMAGES`, which passes in relative file paths of images to use. These are referenced in the `Thing`'s `image` getter (see below). For example:

```
const IMAGES = [
  'assets/wheat_0.jpg',
  'assets/wheat_1.jpg',
  'assets/wheat_2.jpg'
];
```

Other values you need to define that configure the 2D grid:

```
const GRID_HEIGHT = 400;
const GRID_WIDTH = 400;
const GRID_CELL_SIZE = 40;
const GRID_EMPTY = [205, 244, 222];
```

Then the two top-level functions you should define are:

- `init()`: this is equivalent to p5js' `setup()`. Include one-time setup code here.
- `main()`: this is equivalent to p5js' `draw()`. This is called every frame.

# Classes

The main classes:

## `Thing`

Subclass this for objects that can be bought and placed on the grid.

You need to implement the following:

- `get cost()`: this should return an JS object of `{resourceName: resourceCost}`.
- `get info()`: this should return a string describing the thing
- `get image()`: this should return the filename of the image used to represent this thing. It will be forced into a square so keep that in mind.
- `onClick()`: implements a function that's called when the thing is clicked on

You can optionally implement:

- `init()`: called when the thing is first created. You can, for example, setup some initial values for the thing.
- `update(neighbors)`: called every frame and is passed an array of the thing's [Moore neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) in the grid, if any. You can use this, for instance, for cellular automata dynamics and the like (e.g. a blight spreading through a field of crops).

Some built-in methods you'll likely use:

- `destroy()`: removes this thing from the grid, effectively destroying it

## `Bonus`

Use this for bonuses that the player can purchase. It's unlikely that you'll need to subclass this.

To create a bonus:

```
let bonus = new Bonus('super fertilizer', {'cash': 100}, () => {
  STATE.cropGrowth = 2;
});
```
So you pass in a name for the bonus, then its cost, and an optional effect that's called once the bonus is purchased.

You don't need to provide an effect, you can check elsewhere in your code if the player has the bonus with `hasBonus('super fertilizer')` and do things based on that condition.

## `Event` and `Action`

If you want in-game events to occur, you'll use these two classes. Wherever you want to create an event, you can do so like so:

```
let ev = new Event('My event name', 'some description of the event');
```

This will create a modal describing the event. By default this just provides an "OK" button for the player to acknowledge the event. If you want players to choose from specific actions, you can do so like so:

```
let ev = new Event('My event name', 'some description of the event', [
  new Action('Fight', () => {
    STATE.health -= 20;
  }),
  new Action('Run', () => {
    STATE.fatigue += 20;
  })
]);
```

So each `Action` takes an action name and a function that describes what happens as a result of choosing that action.

# Helper functions

The main functions you'll probably use are:

- `showMessage(text, color, timeout, size)`: will show a message on the screen that disappears after `timeout` milliseconds.
- `hasBonus(bonusName)`: lets you check if the player has a particular bonus or not.
- `defineHarvester(name, fn, time)`: sets a function `fn` to be called every `time` seconds. The function is expected to return a number, which is used to modify the resource named `name`.
- `every(ms, fn)`: call the function `fn` every `ms` milliseconds.
- `schedule(ms, fn)`: call the function `fn` once in `ms` milliseconds.
- `tryBuy(thingClass, fn)`: most useful for buttons for buying things(see below). Will try to buy the thing if the player can afford it; if not, it will tell them they can't afford it and how much it costs. An optional function `fn` can be passed, which is called if the thing is successfully bought.

# UI

The main UI elements are `Menu`, `Modal`, and `Button`. `Menu` and `Modal` are similar, and more or less function as ways of grouping `Button`s together.

The `Menu` class is well-suited for, well, menus, such as those players can buy things from:

```
let menu = new Menu('Farm Mall', [
  new Button('Buy Water Collector', tryBuy(WaterCollector, () => {
    STATE.waterCollectors += 1;
    showMessage('Bought water collector!');
  })),
  new Button('Buy Wheat', tryBuy(Wheat))
]);
```

So buttons basically take a title and then a function that's executed if that button is clicked.

One thing of note with the `Menu` class it that when you create a new `Menu`, it will automatically have a button added to the page that will open that menu when clicked.

The `Modal` class is very similar to the `Menu` class, but as the name suggests more appropriate for modals/popups.
